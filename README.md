Implement the Scroll behavior as shown in the attached MP4 file using HTML5 Canvas. 

This will involve but not limited to:

1) Create a sample dataset which contains data from t=0 to t=100.

2) Create an axes which is initially drawn from t=0 to t=10.

3) Create a Run button on a page.

4) When clicked, it should plot the data from t=0 to t=10 and then start scrolling (from left to right) till it reaches t=100. The labels along the x-axis should also get updated.
